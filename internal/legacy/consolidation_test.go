// Package legacy_test asserts the structural integrity of the B4.b
// consolidation under chora-delivery per M12.2.C.
//
// chora-classroom / chora-training-admin / chora-examadmin /
// chora-campusops / chora-wbl were five separate top-level Go services
// prior to 2026-05-12. M12.2.C consolidates their Content Delivery
// responsibilities into chora-delivery, leaving the originals in place
// (Batch 5 will archive them).
//
// This test file does NOT import the sub-packages directly — that would
// create a coupling we don't need at the top-level. It serves as a
// compile-time anchor + TDD RED gate that we have ported the legacy
// code into the expected layout. The sub-packages themselves carry the
// real coverage tests, ported verbatim from the legacy services with
// only the package declaration changed.
//
// Pattern mirrors B4.a (chora-creation legacy consolidation).

// TestConsolidationLayout pins the B4.b sub-package layout. If any of
// the legacy sub-packages disappear or are renamed without an explicit
// migration, this test fails loudly via the build.
